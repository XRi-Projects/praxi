IEEMP (Immersive Educational Experience Management Platform) 

Design and study immersive 360 video experiences incorporating single and multi-perspective video to facilitate teacher education of future elementary teachers. Build the platform for immersive educational experiences to help teachers and students for a better learning experience and analysis of view patterns using recorded logs files.

Praxi is to develop a system for immersive educational experiences in the realm of extended reality. We will be using this platform to study immersive 360 video experiences incorporating single and multi-perspective video to facilitate teacher education of future elementary teachers. In the application, we will use the 360 video records in a spherical manner and will immerse the viewer into the classroom environment; it allows you to look up to down, anywhere around. Together, the various camera angles build the virtual reality experience where future educators can develop their skills â€“ and identify students that need extra help. While users experience 360 videos, we will be recording their behavior, perspective and analyzing those recordings. We will create the final summary report analyzing each recording learn what will be the best approach for proper education in the classroom. These reports will provide another pathway for teachers to learn how to interact with their students.
